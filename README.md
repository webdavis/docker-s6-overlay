# docker-s6-overlay

Docker images packaged with s6-overlay for various architectures.

> \[!NOTE\]
> Learning how to use s6 is quite the undertaking. The [official s6
> documentation][official-s6-documentation] is so bad that it probably makes things worse. One
> of the goals of this repo is to eventually offer beginner-friendly documentation, including
> examples and templates, for building multi-service containers using `s6-overlay-v3`.
